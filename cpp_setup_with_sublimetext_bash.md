## NOTE: C++ Guidelines for Windows 10 users.

## EDITOR
  * **Sublime text** -> Download from here - https://www.sublimetext.com/3 <br/>
  * Install and start writing C++ codes. <br/>
  * **color theme** - Preferences >> Mariana <br/>

## COMPILER
  * Download ```mingw for windows``` from here - https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
  * Install and then add path e.g. - ```"C:\Program Files (x86)\mingw-w64\i686-8.1.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0\mingw32\bin""``` to environment variables.
  * Now one can try from cmd 
    ```$ g++ -std=c++17 hello.cpp -o hello.out``` or ```$ gcc -std=c++17 hello.cpp -o hello.out```or ```$ g++ -std=c++17 hello.cpp```

  * In Windows, .exe file will be created. In Linux, .out file will be created.
  * ```$ ./a.exe```
  * Give the output.
  
## CMD 
#### NOTE: You can use the ```windows``` cmd for compiling c++ files. But for better color and using linux-like commands like ls, we use ```Git-bash```.

Steps:
  * Download Git from here - https://git-scm.com/downloads
  * During installation, follow the recommended options.
  * Now, open and make the changes in - 'options'
  * color theme -> options >> Looks >> Theme: dracula
  * Transparency -> options >> transparency: Medium
  * DONE.
